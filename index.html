	Hey, so this is felt a little weird when I was writing this. I mean writing about myself alwasys felt weird to me, cause who would want to write about their boring selves when they can write the story of an amazing imaginary character you created on your own. I mean, I'm always imagining about an imaginary life. Is it just me, i don't know maybe I'm weirder than I think. Well, at least that means I'm different in my own way "question mark". Anyway enough of this rant, you're here because you want to read what I writ about myself or maybe you're just some stranger who came across this page somehow, i don't know. Hope you like redaing it, I wouldn't.

	So let's start with my name shall we? My name is <strong>Lieneilson Firdaus</strong>, but noone calls me with my fullname(obviosly). Who would call you with your fullname everytime you meet? I'll tell you who do, most teachers! You know? Because they're doing the rollcall to make sure everybody is present. But all jokes aside, I've got a lot of nicknames. My family usually called me with their own version of my name <em>"Sensen"</em>. I don't know ecxacly how they come to this name, but that's what they usually call me. When I was starting school the teacher asked me what is my nickname and i replied with silence. To be fair I was only like 4 or 5 yeras old by that time maybe(I'm to lazy to actually remember but i'm dilligent enough to add this in). So the teacher decided to call me <em>"Neilson"</em>. So I already have two nicknames, when i go to the church and meet children my age and got asked what's my name I would <strike>usually</strike> always just let my mom answer it. So I the people at my church ended up calling me with the same name my family called me. This created some problem, because I go to school with this one kid that have a brother that went to the same church as me. So when I came to their house, they would called me by different nickname and they would actually argue about which one is my actual nickname. Till this very day I will always get nervous when people I just met asked me what my name is. I would actually silently freak out and they just stared at me waiting for answer. So I just let them called me with whatever they wanted to call me with. Yes I know that's a bad idea, I ended up with nicknames like <em>"Daus"</em> but at least I'm not the one that told them to call me that, I just allowed them. Which reminds me of this one time when my mother met my homeroom teacher and my teacher called me Daus. My mother freaked out and I'm not even joking. I don't know why she found it so funny, seriously she would bring it up everytime she got the cahnce to. Man that was along paragraph talking only about my name, I'm so egosentric aren't I? But I'm not finished just yet. I don't like it when my friends at school called me "Sensen", I don't know why. Maybe I unconciosly hated that name, but than it would be strange why I like names starting with <u>"Sor"</u> so much. Like Soren, Sorin, Sorey, Sorata, Sora, Soran, and others. Everytime in a game where I can name my character I would always use one of them if I don't know the default name. Also for some reason I like to use default name if I can in a game just because I think it emphasize the story more. All character in anime, game, movies, drama, just any character with that name in general is just usually my favourit character.

	Ok enough about my name, since I spend so lon to just talk about my name let's actually just go on a quick fire round for other things shall we?
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Birthday : 7<sup>th</sup> of July 2001</li>
		<li>Birthplace : Jakarta</li>
		<li>Age : 16 (going to be 17 soon can't wait till I got more paper with my name on it></li>
		<li>Gender : Male (not gay)</li>
		<li>School : I'm currently studying in a vocational school in SMAKBO mainly focusing in Chemical analysis (and here I am coding, JK i love coding been a while since the last time I've typed so much things). I'm on my second year</li>
		<li>Dream Job : I would like to be an analyst since I've <strike>wasted</strike> spend most of my life in this school. But I would also like to be a writer or a director of some sort</li>
		<li>Idol : I used to not idiolize many people when I was young because I was so <strike>awesome</strike>(JK).
